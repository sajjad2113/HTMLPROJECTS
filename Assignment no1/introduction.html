    <font size="6">MY name is sajjad. I am a dedicated and motivated student from Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan,
         a region known for its natural beauty and rich culture. I completed my matriculation from the Karachi Board,
          where I built a strong academic foundation, and later completed my intermediate education from the Federal Board Islamabad.
           Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at the Barani Institute of Information Technology (BIIT).
            I have a strong interest in coding and enjoy solving problems through programming, which has helped me develop logical thinking and technical skills.
             I am also highly interested in Artificial Intelligence and eager to explore how modern technologies can shape the future and solve real-world problems.
              Along with academics, I have a keen interest in sports, which help me stay active, disciplined, and mentally refreshed. 
              I believe in hard work, consistency, and continuous learning, 
              and I aim to become a skilled computer science professional who can contribute positively to society while proudly representing my region.
